## DOSSIER NOT FOUND
You were closely involved in the study, creation, or maintenance of a prime non-human person. Nonhuman persons, or NHPs, are complex artificial intelligences. As a prime NHP, the one you were associated with` was even more complex than most. 

Did you interact with that entity like a scientist or engineer, or more like a priest or shaman? Do you have a personal connection to them, after all this time? How do clones of that NHP perceive you? And now that youâ€™re a pilot, how do you feel about nonhuman intelligence?

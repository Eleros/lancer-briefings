## DOSSIER NOT FOUND
You were a medical specialist in your old life. How did you wind up piloting a mech? What was your specialty? Did you work in research, care, or trauma? Did you love the life and take your duty seriously, or did you see yourself as an organic mechanic? 

You might have worked in a colony or on a core world, in private practice, for a corporation, or on a noble familyâ€™s payroll: Did you operate a small frontier practice, or work in a blink station urgent care center, or in a massive hospital campus? Were you a whitecoat or an EMT? Is there a memory that haunts you, or one that gives you comfort?

Vic - Victor as his parents know him, V to his friends - was one of the smartest kids in his boarding school. However, his reckless attitude and lack of respect for authority meant he often got himself into trouble. The course of his life changed forever when he found an old shuttle in a farmer's garage and decided to "take it out for a spin." The owner, a former pilot in the Navy, was awestruck by his natural talent and offered to teach him what he knew. Now V is known as the "man without fear," showing off his skills all across the galaxy.

# Mycol Fields // 09.01.5014u

Mycol Fields is experiencing a staggering influx of refugees from Hivehome. Its available housing has already reached capacity and now its emergency response teams, medical population, and rangers are hurriedly trying to set people up in the surrounding fields and scattered towns. The agricultural space that defined Mycol Fields has quickly become a sprawling tent city; there is no land inside or around the city-state that has not been settled by weary refugees. The work of keeping them supplied, keeping them safe, and treating them for injuries and illnesses is, as with so many other aspects of this moment in the HUC’s history, the work of triage – a losing, but valiant battle. Many will be saved; more will die. This is the absolute best anyone can do as literally millions of survivors make the journey to Mycol Fields.

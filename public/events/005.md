The FRT has their first meeting with a living Egregorian, **DUSK**.

Dusk explains the problem to the team: For several days, the last of the refugees have been straggling out of the ruins of Hivehome. The HUC’s rangers are spread far too thin to cover all the ground they need for a safe passage and – worse – they believe they are being hunted. Though Beggar One seems to be preoccupied with other matters, its forces still crawl over the valley. For days, the rangers have tracked an enormous energy signature – a large force of machines, likely – that has been closing in on their location and they don’t think they have the forces to fight it in the open.

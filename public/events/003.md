# Gray Towns // 06.06.5014u

The FRTs' new objective becomes the evacuation of Merricktown and Liu Maize and the securement of Evergreen’s outer borders. 

Edena is strangely unconcerned about the evacuation of the Gray Towns and tasks the characters with this out of convenience more than anything. The bulk of the militia is already engaged in defensive preparations around Evergreen: digging trench lines, laying minefields and mire pits, stocking arms caches, stockpiling food and water, packing sandbags, and so on.

Following the trail of the subalterns and eventually linking up with the main march isn’t difficult: the FRT just need to follow the trail of destruction. The machines don’t attack the team and it is essentially impossible to stop the flow in any meaningful way. As the horde advances, many more machines rip themselves out of the earth to follow, long-deactivated and buried relics of an old war. 

The subalterns march east through the woods, tributaries of machines linking together to form a mighty river. They move steadily, eventually reaching their destination: not Tower 3, but a clearing at the base of Tower 3’s mountain.

Thousands of subalterns have been digging into the earth here, forming a great pit a hundred meters across and dozens deep. The team holds the line, until suddenly up they come from some forgotten, alien sepulcher; an army out of its time, crawling and clambering at first, and then marching in orderly, endless ranks, as they grind the mud below their mechanical feet to packed earth. They are legion. 

Extracting themselves from the situation, the team is able to clear some distance and proceed along the road to a safe point where they are no longer being followed. From there, they can watch as the horde tears itself out of the mountain, during which they receive a troubling update from Edena: the event they have just witnessed is happening everywhere. The Gray Towns, Liu Maize, and Merricktown are all under attack from the horde, which is boiling forth from the earth and striking toward Evergreen.

Patience hails the team on a priority channel, sounding stressed and asking for an immediate meeting. For now, the group chooses to keep the call from Dthall and the situation with the Hercynians to themselves. As the team make their way through the streets of Evergreen, they pass numerous subalterns and work drones from the colony that seem to be going haywire. Many of them are drifting patiently but inexorably away from their handlers like errant cattle – all heading east.

It is an unfortunate consequence of Landmark’s strict cycling calendar that Patience is due for a routine cycling. Every NHP has their own regular schedule, and while it has come at a problematic time for Patience, it does mean that they’ll be at full operational and cognitive capacity once they’re out. The process will take anywhere from 12–48 hours. During that time, Patience will be unavailable and Edena Ji will run the colony.

Meanwhile, subalterns and drones across the entirety of Evergreen’s eastern border and the lands beyond are responding to a shielded omninet transmission. Military-grade scrambling makes it difficult to determine where, exactly, the broadcast is issuing from, but there is a likely culprit: **TOWER 3**, the omninet/comms tower atop the eastern valley wall, another hundred kilometers east of Liu Maize and Merricktown. It’s a powerful relay tower that, if accessed manually, could be reconfigured to broadcast via an on-site override. If Tower 3 isn’t the culprit, then it’s still in the east, and worth checking on. 

Worryingly, Patience notes, the transmission has grown stronger in the last few hours. They issue the group a new mission to mount up and investigate.

The attackers haven’t been seen for weeks. Raiders, pirates, whoever they are, they have been forced to fall back. The colony settles into a routine resembling something like to normalcy. Things seem to have settled down – at least until Elijah receives a mysterious call over an open comm channel, using outdated comm protocols – at least several centuries old.

Picking up and connecting the rest of the team, they are hailed by someone with heavy accent. She introduces herself as **DTHALL ORDO** and claims to be a leader of the **HIVEHOME** rangers.

Dthall tells the FRT that she regrets the attacks on the colony and has decided to reach out on her own terms, a decision that approaches outright insubordination. It was not her choice to escalate aggression against the colony so rapidly, and in her opinion it was a waste of resources and good soldiers that could have been used against a greater enemy.

Dthall explains that her rangers are winding down operations against Evergreen, salvaging what they can, and collecting the dead. The colony is no longer a priority concern for the **HERCYNIAN UNITED CITIES**, and the rangers have been ordered to pull back on all fronts. She asks that there be a break in the fighting for this one day. There is a bigger threat coming, Dthall tells the team – one that the rangers could not stop – and her reason for calling is to give a warning about a force she calls **"THE MACHINE"**.

Almost immediately, a priority transmission from Patience reaches the FRT.

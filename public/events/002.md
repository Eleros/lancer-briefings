The FRT has some time to recuperate, repair, and update their loadout. 

During this period, Elijah sets about reaching out to the citizens of Evergreen – joining search and rescue operations, and using every tool available to him, mech and all, for healing and reconstruction. Roland on the other hand busies himself by negotiating with Gray Town citizens for their aid in the rebuilding efforts in return for a future favor. Sadly, his Random Reserves is counted among the collateral damage of the battle and thus has to suspend services for the near future. Meanwhile, Victor continues his efforts in digging up the past on the cusp of a great discovery.

As the team approaches the colony, the perimeter suddenly lights up with fire as the attacks resume and all hell breaks loose. 

The Hercynians make a last-ditch attempt to smash Evergreen, aiming for the heart: the colony’s **OMNINODE**. 

Desperate, the attackers have activated a trump card: **REGRET**, a salvaged Hercynian Crisis–era Enkidu chassis. Used in the final stages of the **TOTAL BIOME KILL**, these mechs were extremely volatile shock troopers built to engage and shred masses of **EGREGORIAN** warriors at extremely close range. The expected survival rate of their pilots was not high, and they were typically piloted with the aid of pyschoactive stimulants.

The FRT reach REGRET just as it breaches the walls of Evergreen and are able to intercept it before it proceeds further. In the background, the remaining Hercynian forces trade fire with the colony’s militia.

Regretfully, the team fails to defeat the Ultra unit, losing even their previously captured mechs in combat. A large number of civilian buildings were destroyed in the fighting, leading to a high number of casualties. The enemy continues its push into the city but lose the Enkidu due to a reactor meltdown before they can reach the Omninode. Unwilling to take further casualties, the Hercynian forces pull back in an organized retreat.

The reactors are downriver, constructed away from Evergreen proper. By the time the team arrives, the Hercynians have already destroyed **STABLE REACTOR 1**’s power regulator, critically disabling the reactor. If they destroy the regulator for **STABLE REACTOR 2**, Evergreen will be without power.

The FRT defeats the strike team before the power regulator is damaged and captures another enemy mech, this time a Support frame, as well as its pilot. The attack on the reactor is over and the colony seems safe for the moment. The enormous militia construction hauler that brought them to the reactor gives them a ride back to the colony.

When the attack arrives, it comes hard and fast. 

Wherever they are, it's late night as the FRT is knocked out of their reverie by the sound of gunfire and explosions. As the alarm goes up across Evergreen, messages begin to filter in through MILCOMM channels that the settlement is under attack.

The team manages to route the the Hercynians and even capture a Bombard mech in pristine condition. But they only have a moment to catch their breath before Patience pushes a priority message to them: As it turns out, the attack was mearly a feint meant to create a distraction while a Hercynian strike team infiltrates the **STABLE REACTOR PLANT**, the source of the colony’s power, and attempts to destroy the two reactor towers. Patience has diverted a number of militia to the defense of the two reactor towers, but they need immediate backup.

As spring draws to its end, Patience convenes a defense council, summoning the FRT, Brava Hadura, and a few other militia officers to review intelligence and decide a strategy for the ongoing defense of Evergreen. 

They report that they have finalized a connection to one of their meteorological satellites; with some calibration, it will be able to capture static data as it crosses Evergreen to image for broad-theater intelligence; namely, to look for any sign of the enemy's supply lines, bases, and depots.

In the meantime, they will continue to monitor the situation regarding the anomalous machines and prepare the armory accordingly; however, at this time the primary threat remains the raiders and Evergreen requests that they be the team's main priority.

The FRT's efforts at pushing back the raids have not gone unnoticed. There are disturbing reports of increased activity close to the colony border. Whoever these people are and whatever their goal is, they are preparing for something big. Patience puts the colony at its maximum security level and asks the team to be on high alert. They are asked to stay around the colony while Evergreen scouts try to predict the movements of the Hercynian raiders.

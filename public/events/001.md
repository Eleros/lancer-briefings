# En route to the Landing Bowl // 3.19.5014u

The **HERCYNIANS** attack the convoy almost as soon as it exits the city but the FRT manages to protect the engineers and drive out the enemy. 

Fielding and his team successfully get the pump system up and running. It’s automated, and they can post a remote-operable sightseer nexus in the bowl that will allow them to reliably surveil the site in case the Hercynians return. Once the landing bowl is drained, larger ships will be able to land near Evergreen.

As the FRT are on their way back to Evergreen, Patience pushes an update to them. Something is happening east of Evergreen, in the fields where “nobody” lives.

# Evergreen // 3.19.5014u

**PATIENCE**, the colony’s administrator, schedules the team for a morning meeting to formally introduce them to the city and its administrative staff. Patience is kind, though firm in all of their positions. They allow the team to download a map of Evergreen and surrounding environs, give them access to the printing facilities, and grant them the freedom to pass through all areas of the city as required.

After answering the team's questions, Patience gets down to the task at hand and briefs them on their first mission. They give the team a choice of two vital tasks, of which they pick to escort Chief Engineer **FIELDING** and some of his workers and protect them while they complete critical repairs at the settlement’s **LANDING BOWL**, so it can be drained and given essential updates; this will make offworld landings easier and allow larger ships to land at Evergreen without the use of shuttles.

The team's printer permissions come into effect just after they finish talking to Patience, allowing them start printing their mechs.

# UNION Shuttle Carrier // 3.18.5014u

As the FRT set their sights on Hercynia, the drop carrier's captain notifies them to suit up - and make sure to borrow some EVA gear if they don't have any. Time is of the essence, and time is money. The team straps into one of a few dropships, and preps for the descent.

As they approach the world, their ship’s SIGINT deck reports that Hercynia is throwing off an incredible amount of noise – likely because it is a post-collapse SecComm “punching bag” world littered with old, decaying military infrastructure, and ruins – and they find themselves unable to get clear signals. All of this matches the thin profile pushed to them by local flightcomm. Unfortunately, optics are shot as well. Hercynia appears to be socked in under a planetwide monsoon season, blanketing all but the most extreme poles with thick cloud cover.

The team lands safely, dismounts from the shuttle, and begins assembling their gear as a small group approaches the shuttle. The group introduces themselves as a militia, with **BRAVA HADURA** as their Commander. She quickly informs them to get moving – and stay low, as there's a sniper in the area. The shuttle then begins its automated launch sequence, only to return a year from now. 

The troopers lead the way to **EVERGREEN**, a city brutalized by growth. The tall apartment blocks stand a dozen stories high, grime-streaked white monoliths wrapped in cling-tight plastic, looming above the low, mixedmaterial buildings. The colony is bordered by a low wall, buildings bulging right up against the barrier as if it were a waistline cinched tight by an unforgiving belt. Smoke drifts up from the dense settlement, blending with the low rain clouds.

Once they reach the **GOVERNOR'S FARM**, the team has their particulars entered in the city's database, so they can come and go without triggering the colony's defenses. Brava informs them that they should take some time to get settled in. For now, the team will be offered functional, comfortable lodging in the **BOTTOM OF THE WELL**, a tavern in one of the more populated districts of Evergreen.

# UNION Transport Carrier // 3.15.5014u

A jade and white disk hangs on the velvet field above you. **HERCYNIA**. A planet in the fullness of its bloom, and yet. Even from afar you can see the swell of ocean- spanning supercells. Where it parts, it shows land pockmarked with the telltale craters of prolonged orbital bombardment in the distant past. 

A catastrophe unfolded here. Half a millennia ago an expeditionary force sent by Union's **SECOND COMMITTEE** assaulted Hercynia as part of its imperialist advance across the galaxy. Though the anthrochauvanist hegemon was overthrown and replaced in a coup by the **THIRD COMMITTEE OF UNION**, the relics of its legacy still linger in places like this. 

Noise trickles from the planet. Ancient encrypted comms and distress beacons corrupted by the march of time and blooms of fallout radiation near the planet's poles. Ghost signals from long dead lips, from a long forgotten war. 

Your good fortune has brought you here out of necessity, and because your **UNION AUXILIARY FIRST RESPONSE TEAM** was the closest when the sector's administrator came calling. Trouble has befallen a recently-established colony on Hercynia’s surface. 

The colony’s charter is held by **LANDMARK COLONIAL**, a **SMITH-SHIMANO CORPO** subsidiary specializing in the settlement of difficult worlds. Exact details about the situation are spotty. The administrator believes there may be a previously-undocumented indigenous population on the planet. 

Your orders are to make contact with Landmark Colonial’s representatives, integrate into the colony's affairs, and assess the situation the ground. As representatives of Union, you are expected to act accordingly, with the dignity and respect befitting your station. 

**You are the mechanized cavalry.** Astride steeds of steel you dropped into the fray more times than you can remember. This is your story. 

**And now, as it ever was, there is No Room for a Wallflower.**
